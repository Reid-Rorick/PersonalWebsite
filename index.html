            <p style="margin:0; font-size:120%;">
                Hello, I am from Flower Mound, Texas, and I am currently a Junior at the Michael F. Price College of Business.
                I am majoring in Management Information Systems expecting to graduate in May 2024 from The University of Oklahoma. 
                <br /><br />
                Every year I go on a mission trip with Liberty Christian School as a college leader during spring break with a selective amount of other
                college students. For the past two summers I have worked at Camp Sweeney in Gainesville, Texas. My first summer I worked as a Junior PA 
                (program assistant) and for the summer of 2022 I worked as a Senior PA. As a Senior PA, I co-lead a team of 5 college men to help organize
                and facilitate daily camp life and camp events. I am proficient in microsoft excel, powerpoint, and word. I have also had two dedicated
                classes to C# programming using Visual Studio. I am also a member of the fraternity Beta Upsilon Chi and 
                Management Information Systems Student Association(MISSA). I love making life more efficient and solving problems. I am constantly updating
                previous projects I have worked on to make them the most efficient, as well as constantly updating my budgeting system, planner, and calendar
                system. I also love helping people; anytime someone needs help, even if it is something I am not very knowledgeable on, I will do my best
                to help resolve the issue.
